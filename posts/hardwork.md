There is something to be said about the sense of focus during hardwork. One of the best ways to be happy is not to worry about being happy. It is like someone telling you to avoid thinking of a pink elephant. You're thinking of one now, aren't you? When you aren't trying to pursue it actively it shows up in your day-to-day.
