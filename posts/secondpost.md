I have always been of the opinion that somehow animated characters emote much better and they can craft outlandish stories and build amazing worlds in the animated medium, so this is an appreciation post, which is by far not exhaustive. I could possibly make a series of review posts for all the Anime I have consumed over the years. 

## Demon Slayer : Kimetsu no Yaiba

I was a fearless seeker of anime a couple of years ago and due to various reasons I have been unable to keep up. The ongoing lockdown gave me a chance to revisit this glorious wonderland though and this came in the form of a Netflix suggestion for Demon Slayer. 

If you haven't watched this particular one, I hihgly recommend it. It takes all the usual tropes and turns them around in a fun way. You have your usual characters but there's a well defined system to the fighting which I am always a fan of. One suggestion though, maybe don't binge watch this one as there's only a single season out with 26 episodes. Season 2 is in the works but has been delayed.
