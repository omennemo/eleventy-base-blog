I am confident that most folks who graduated engineering around the same time I did and from around the same area have never come across half of the things I did in the Missing Semester videos that I came across thanks to HackerNews. 
There are around 11 videos in the entire [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyzOVJj3bHQuloKGG59rS43e29ro7I57J) and so far I have slowly been making my way through them. I highly recommend checking these out as they will either refresh your existing knowledge about these concepts or they will teach you a thing or two.
The most important thing being that you keep your mind and the terminal on you machine open to consume the excellent content they are putting out. I feel like many people I recommend these things to have always told me to put these cool shiny things down on a blog and this is me doing just that. 
The thing about spending so much time at a screen is that you are always looking for the next thing that makes your life easy or the next language that promises to do that difficult concept just right. But there are some old-school things that will never change and are as basic to the existence of someone who interacts with code that taking a step back to reassess once in a while is a welcome change.

Do let me know if it was worth your while to go through these courses.
Thanks!
