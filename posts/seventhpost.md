I was watching the Korean Sci-Fi Crime Drama called Signal(2015) on Netflix when I happened to see that one of the main characters was handling an envelope that had the logo of EMS.
In the exact pattern and typeface that I have seen in India. I was intrigued and made a mental note to look this up and this is what I found.

EMS or Express Mail Service is an international concept and it's managed by each country's postal organisation. I have heard it called speed post as I was growing up. These days it has probably been oversahdowed by the multitude of delivery services.
Nevertheless it was still interesting to see something that I thought was the creation of Indian Post to actually be a global thing. 

In any case if you're reading this far you should probably go and catch the show Signal on Netflix, it takes its timeto get to the real intriguing parts but over all it's a good concept.
I have gotten suggestions on Netflix that there is a Japanese rendition of the same thing and I was thinking of watching that as well.
