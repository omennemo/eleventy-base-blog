I liked the idea of this word. Teleological. The dictionary definition of it is "exhibiting or relating to design or purpose especially in nature". That doesn't tell you much about why it inspired a whole concept in my mind. 
The idea that we tell stories to fit our current situation and forget about what actually happened is something I think all of us do on a daily basis. Even in our own lives. I am reading more about this in the late David Graeber's book called "Dawn of Everything". I expect I will be penning down more thoughts here soon as I make progress on this really cool book.
