I had started using vim if you have been following along. After spending a lot of time configuring it, playing with it, installing all the plugins I could find,
I realised that unless I could find a way to make it work on the machine I use most daily it would hold absolutely no value to me. And I didn't just want it to 
kinda work I wanted it to work exactly how I want it to. I am not completely there yet but I think I have come awfully close. I wanted speed and all the bells and whistles
that you get these days with most editors. I didn't want to compromise on the ease of doing things. To add to things VSCode has been awful these past few months.

And so when I was able to make WSL 1 work on my work machine, things started looking up. Now I can have all the fzf and ripgrep goodness. I can do all this from the 
not-so-perfect confines of my work machine. 

I love being able to open the editor and hop in and one of my close friends who has been using vim for years advised me that the best thing to make this happen is to 
use only the plugins that you actually need. I will be following up this post with all the tips and tricks I came across, not for anyone elses sake but maybe just mine. 

If you're at this point you really want to work on vim/nvim so hit me up. I can assist on this journey with whatever little I have learned :)
