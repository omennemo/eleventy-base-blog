I have long been an admirer of a good text editor that keeps offering me cool things. I remember long ago trying the plugins in Notepad++ and getting miffed by the fact that they don't work for shit. After trying to debug them for a bit I quickly moved on to an alternative that turned out to be Sublime Text. Then since a lot of my work revolved around the standard setup that my team used I was forced to use Eclipse. Not that there is anything wrong with eclipse but at some point waiting for it to launch while you have an idea bursting out in your head and then having to wait for the tooling to launch as well is a huge pain in the ass. So later on when VSCode came along I adopted that quite quickly. I had frequently interacted with Vim over the years but I never really grasped why it was a big deal. It never occurred to me that I would need the features that it was offering. I guess speed wasn't a factor then. But when you want to move around at the speed you think. I think Vim will help you out in that aspect a lot. 
I think you should keep attempting Vim and come back to it after a break when you can't make sense of it because the gains that you achieve will be much more once you really get in to the groove of working it full time. 

The trick is immersion. Go for it.
