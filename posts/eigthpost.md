The fact that I have not written since crossing into the New Year goes to show that I have not been getting any rest or spending any leisure time for myself. My weekends are as busy as my horribly hectic work weeks. I think under the current climate of a worsening pandemic we should not forget to take some time out for ourselves doing whatever it is we like to do to disengage.

I have found that cooking really helps me disengage as it is as different an activity as can be from my regular work. I love the satisfaction from a dish that has turned out just right. 

Go find your Butter Chicken :)
